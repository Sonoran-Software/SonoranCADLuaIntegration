# Sonoran CAD - Plugins
The Sonoran CAD plugin framework comes with dozens of drag-and-drop ready integration plugins for your gaming community.

## Installation

All plugins follow a similar installation process. For more information, [click here to see our guides.](https://info.sonorancad.com/integration-plugins/integration-plugins)

## Developing

Developing a plugin for the Sonoran Lua Framework is rather simple but requires you to have existing knowledge of how global and local functions and lua objects work. There is also a lot of logic built into the core framework in order to facilitate easy updating which requires particular naming and folder structure.
